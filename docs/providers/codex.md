# Codex provider accounts

Synara can run multiple Codex accounts side by side. Each account is a provider
instance (Settings → Provider tools → Codex → Provider instances) with its own
auth state, so you log in to each account **once** and never need to log out to
switch — sessions, model discovery, health checks, and git text generation all
route to the account selected for the thread.

## How isolation works

Codex reads state from `CODEX_HOME`. Synara asynchronously prepares a generated
overlay under `$SYNARA_HOME/codex-home-overlay` (or the corresponding Synara
runtime directory) and uses an account-specific subdirectory for isolated
instances:

- Shared non-database state is linked from the base Codex home. SQLite files
  are not mirrored; `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME` keeps every process opening them from
  the base home through one stable path.
- Account-private state (`auth.json`, `models_cache.json`) comes from the
  account's **shadow auth home** instead. Missing files are allowed so Codex
  can create new account state lazily, while an existing private file that is
  itself a symlink is rejected to prevent accounts from aliasing credentials.
- Synara writes the generated `config.toml` only inside the overlay and leaves
  the source configuration untouched.

The default instance uses the same overlay mechanism, with authentication and
other shared state sourced from the configured Codex home (`~/.codex` by
default).

## Adding a second account

1. Pick a directory for the account's private auth state, e.g. `~/.codex_work`.
2. Log the Codex CLI into that account once, redirecting its home:

   ```sh
   CODEX_HOME=~/.codex_work codex login
   ```

3. In Synara, open Settings → Provider tools → Codex → Provider instances →
   Add, give the instance a label (e.g. "Work"), and set **Shadow auth home**
   to `~/.codex_work`.
4. Pick the account from the model picker's instance selector when composing.

The login persists in `~/.codex_work/auth.json`. Synara links it into the
account overlay when possible, with a file-copy fallback on systems where file
symlinks are unavailable, and never logs its contents. The overlay is refreshed
during asynchronous process-environment preparation before Codex launches.

## Caveats

- An instance with only a label/account id but **no shadow auth home and no
  dedicated CODEX_HOME** starts signed out and keeps its own login inside its
  managed overlay home. Use a shadow auth home when you want the login to live
  in a directory you control.
- An instance with its own dedicated **CODEX_HOME** mirrors that home's
  credentials, so external `codex login` runs against it stay visible.
- A shadow auth home must be a real directory with real credential files;
  symlinked shadow homes or `auth.json` files are rejected so accounts can
  never alias each other's credentials.
- Threads keep the instance they started with; switching the account of a
  thread with a live session restarts the provider session.
